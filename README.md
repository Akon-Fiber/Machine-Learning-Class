# My Self-paced Machine Learning Curriculum
This is already arranged so that corresponding notes (.md) are in parallel to codes and notebooks

This curriculum primarily uses NumPy on neural network parts and TensorFlow on later parts (RNN, CNN, etc)

## Libraries/Dependencies
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/):

    $ pip install tensorflow    # For CPU-only
    $ pip install tensorflow    # For GPU-accelerated computation

[NumPy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html):

    $ pip install numpy
